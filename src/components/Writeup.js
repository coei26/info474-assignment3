      <h3>Design Decisions Rationale</h3>
      <p>Wanted option of color and non-color for accessibility</p>
      <p>Wanted to prioritize the investigation of data based on geography (i.e., where countries are physically located on the globe)</p>
      <p>Achieved the above by examining individual continents at a time and by giving the option to filter data by latitude (i.e., proximity to equator)</p>
      <h3>Development Process Overview</h3>
      <p>Split up based on different means of interaction</p>
      <p>Spent about X hours in development</p>
      <p>Implementing different interactive elements took the most work</p>
